The *config* generator generates a configuration initializer file for setting up `cream` to use a particular role strategy.

<pre>$ rails g cream:config --strategy NAME</pre>

NAME is the name of a role strategy. 

Strategies with a single role for each user
* admin_field
* role_string
* one_role

Strategies with multiple roles for each user
* roles_mask
* many_roles

Currently role groups are not supported. Feel free to provide an add-on to support this or integrate with an existing 'role group' solution.  

Example usage:

<pre>$ rails g cream:config --strategy admin_field</pre>
